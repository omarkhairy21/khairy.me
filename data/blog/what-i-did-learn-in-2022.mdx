Overall 2022 was a great year for me. I learned a lot of new things and i am very happy with the progress i made. I am sharing what technologies i learned in 2022.

## What i did learn in 2022

### 1. Aws (Amazon Web Services):
While i build my side project windr i got credits for AWS so i had to migrate from GCP(Google cloud) to Aws and i learned a lot about its services.
I learned about the following services:
- Aws Elastic Beanstalk
- Aws Elastic Load Balancer
- Aws Route 53
- Aws S3 (I did use it before but it was a part of the stack)
- Aws RDS (PostgreSQL)
- AWS Container Registry

That knowledge i gained helped me write a blog post about [How to Deploy Strapi Docker Container On AWS Elastic Beanstalk](https://strapi.io/blog/how-to-deploy-strapi-docker-container-on-aws-elastic-beanstalk).
The key lessons:
 - AWS Elastic Load Balancer is great but it is expensive i think i was paying 50$(as credits) per month for it.
 - Aws has a great customer support and they are very helpful in comparison with GCP i could not reach out to the support team!.

 ### 2. Pulumi(Infrastructure as Code):
I learned about Pulumi and i used it to deploy my side project windr to AWS. I am planning to use it more in the future.

 ### 3. Cloudflare Stack
 I joined a new company this year we were using Cloudflare on a daily basis here are some of the services i learned about:
- Cloudflare Workers
- Cloudflare Pages
- Cloudflare DNS
- Cloudflare R2 
- cloudflare KV (Key Value Store)
- Cloudflare Queues (Message Queue)

Key lessons:
- Worker are great for serverless functions and they are very fast but the drawbacks:
     - you can not use any npm packages that has native node.js modules as depndencies.
     - Monitoring collecting logs form the worker it was such hassle you will need to send logs to a third party service with API call! (Cloudflare annouced the last month you can forwards logs with logpush but i did not try it yet)
- Pages are great for static sites.
- KV is most product i love from cloudlare it is a key value store that you can use it as a database or cache.


### 4. Mointroing tools
I learned about the following monitoring tools:
- New Relic
- Datadog

Key lessons:
    - Distrubuted tracing is a great for debugging and discover errors and failures quickly in productions but is not easy to config.
    - I did not use Datadog much but i planing to use it more in the future.

### 5. Render(Render.com)
Like heroku with good developer experience(DX) they provide simple Infrastructure as code API with simple yaml file you can provision your infrastructure.
I did use it deploy two docker cotainers with PostgresSQL. 

Key lessons:
- It is a great tool for deploying docker containers.
- They do not provide good customer support.

### 6. Internal Tools (n8n and tooljet)
I introduced n8n and tooljet to my company and we are using them to build simple and complex workflows with n8n. we are using tooljet for building dashbaords.

Key lessons:
- n8n is great for building workflows: like connecting to different APIs, database and services and build complex workflows.
- tooljet seems appealing but i did not use it much.

### 7. PostgresSQL (DeepDive)
I dig deep into PostgresSQL with a great course [SQL and PostgreSQL: The Complete Developer's Guide](https://www.udemy.com/course/sql-and-postgresql) from one of my favorite instructors of all time Stephen Grider, here are some of the topics i learned about:
- Query Tunning
- How pages are stored in the database
- How indexes are stored in the database
- Schemas and how to use them.

I have not finished the course yet but i am planing to finish it in 2023.
