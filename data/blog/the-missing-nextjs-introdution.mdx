# The Missing Next.js Introduction

I remember the fisrt days when i started learning Next.js,
i was so confused about some concepts and terms that i was reading about in the

## What is Next.js?

Next.js is a React framework that allows you to build server-side rendered React applications. It is built on top of React, Webpack, and Babel. It is a very powerful framework that allows you to build server-side rendered React applications with ease.

## The Problem with React

React is a great framework for building user interfaces. It is a very powerful framework that allows you to build complex user interfaces with ease. However, it is not a complete framework.
It does not provide you with a way to build server-side rendered React applications. This is where Next.js comes in.

## What is Server-Side Rendering?

Server-side rendering is the process of rendering a web page on the server and sending the rendered HTML to the client.
This is different from client-side rendering, where the HTML is rendered on the client.

## The severless computing

Serverless computing is a cloud computing execution model in which the cloud provider runs the server, and dynamically manages the allocation of machine resources. Pricing is based on the actual amount of resources consumed by an application, rather than on pre-purchased units of capacity. It is a form of utility computing.

## where the serverless computing is used in next.js ?

In The Next.js framework, the serverless computing is used in the serverless functions, which are functions that are executed on the server, and are triggered by an HTTP request. They are used to handle API requests, and are executed on the server, rather than on the client.

## What is the difference between serverless functions and server-side rendering?

## The edge computing

Edge computing is a distributed computing paradigm that brings computation and data storage closer to the location where it is needed to improve response times and save bandwidth. It is a form of cloud computing that uses the edge of the network to perform computations.

## The cloudlfare edge network (Cloudflare wokres)

Cloudflare Workers is a serverless computing platform that allows you to run JavaScript code on the edge of Cloudflare's network.

## Where the edge computing is used in next.js ?

The edge computing is used in Middlewares
