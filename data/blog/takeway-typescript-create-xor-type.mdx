## The Problem

Last week i encountered a type porblem where i had existing type, let say x it as the following type

```typescript
type example = {
  x: string
  y: string
}
```

I wanted to add z to the type but i wanted to make sure that only one of the y or z is present at a time.
But not both at the same time.

## The Solution

Simple that is a XOR problem. I can create a XOR type in typescript like this

```typescript
type Without<T, U> = { [P in Exclude<keyof T, keyof U>]?: never }

type XOR<T, U> = T | U extends object ? (Without<T, U> & U) | (Without<U, T> & T) : T | U
```

## let's break it down

- `Without<T, U>` : This is a utility type that will return the properties of T that are not present in U.
- `T | U extends object` : This is a conditional type that checks if T or U is an object
- `(Without<T, U> & U) | (Without<U, T> & T)` : This is the actual XOR type. It checks if T is present and U is not present and vice versa.
- `T | U` : This is the base case. If T or U is not an object then it will just return T or U.

## Example

```typescript
type example = {
  x: string
} & XOR<{ y: string }, { z: string }>

const a: example = {
  x: 'hello',
  y: 'world',
} // it works

const b: example = {
  x: 'hello',
  z: 'world',
} // it works

const c: example = {
  x: 'hello',
  y: 'world',
  z: 'world',
} // it does not work
```

## But there is a problem

when you hover over the type in your IDE you will see a lint error like this

<img src="/static/images/xor-lint-error.png" alt="XOR Lint Error" width="200" height="200" />

The type is very hard to read and understand. I was playing around to make it look pretty i found type package called [ts-xor](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ts-xor) which does the same thing but it looks pretty.

Here is result of using ts-xor

```typescript
import type { XOR } from 'ts-xor'

type example = {
  x: string
} & XOR<{ y: string }, { z: string }>
```

here how it looks in the IDE:

<img
  src="/static/images/pretty-xor-lint.png"
  alt="Pretty XOR Lint Error"
  width="200"
  height="200"
/>
