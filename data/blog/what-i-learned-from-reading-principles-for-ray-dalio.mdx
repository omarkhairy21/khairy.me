# What I Learned From Reading Principles life and work by Ray Dalio

## Introduction

I did not know who ray dalio until i watch How the economic machine works by Ray Dalio.
[![How the economic machine works by Ray Dalio](http://img.youtube.com/vi/PHe0bXAIuk0/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHe0bXAIuk0 'How the economic machine works by Ray Dalio')

It may be the most clearified , well explained video about how the economic works I have ever seen,
it took me too much time to discover and read about that by myself(i wish i had watched it earlier)

I got too many insights as well as the book itself empasize about them more and more. Here are some of them:

1. When the central bank prints a lot of money, buy stocks, gold and commodities(like oil)

## What i expect from this book

I expect to learn more about how the economic works, us economy, the history of the us dollar and economy. So far i found what i expected and more.

### The Importance of Principles

> All successful people operate by
> principles that help them be successful, though what they choose to be
> successful at varies enormously, so their principles vary.
> To be principled means to consistently operate with principles that can be
> clearly explained. Unfortunately, most people can’t do that. And it’s very rare
> for people to write their principles down and share them.

When i reflect that on myself i discovered, i do have principles i got or inherit from community, refligon and education howerver they are not bold enough
or i would take some time to point them out someone if he/she asks me.

> I’d like to know which principles are
> most important to the politicians who want me to vote for them and to all the
> other people whose decisions affect me. Do we have common principles that
> bind us together—as a family, as a community, as a nation, as friends across
> nations? Or do we have opposing principles that divide us? What are they?

I do belive i have principles However they are not bold enough that makes me think and write them down:

My principles are:

- Working hard every day would pay off
- Never stop learning and reading
- Be honest, never lie
- Be transparent, honest and clear with people
- Tell the truth what whatever it takes
- Take the responsibility to my actions and
- Embrace failures as leaning opportunities.
- Take conservative risks and be ready to fail
- Do not judge people.

I may have more principles i will add more and refine them later.

## When Mexico Defaulted on Its Debt in 1982

That was a very interesting story with too many insights. I did not get the whole Lessons but i got some of them.

> In August 1982, Mexico defaulted on its debt. By then, it was clear to most
> everyone that a number of other countries were about to follow. This was a
> huge deal, because U.S. banks had lent about 250 percent of their capital to
> other countries just as at risk as Mexico. Business loan activity in the U.S.
> ground to a halt.
> After Mexico’s default, the Fed responded to the economic collapse and
> debt defaults by making money more readily available. This caused the stock
> market to jump by a record amount. While that surprised me, I interpreted it
> as a knee-jerk reaction to the Fed’s move.

What did ray do ?

> To hedge against the worst
> possibilities, I bought gold and T-bill futures as a spread against eurodollars,
> which was a limited-risk way of betting on credit problems increasing.
> I was dead wrong. After a delay, the economy responded to the Fed’s
> efforts, rebounding in a noninflationary way. In other words, inflation fell
> while growth accelerated. The stock market began a big bull run, and over the
> next eighteen years the U.S. economy enjoyed the greatest noninflationary
> growth period in its history.

it raises many questions for me

1. Why did Mexico default on its debt?
2. How could the US banks lend about 250 percent of their capital to Mexico and other countries?
3. Why did the stock market to jump by a record amount?
4. Why did the economy responded to the Fed’s efforts, rebounding in a noninflationary way?
5. Why did ray buy gold and T-bill futures as a spread against eurodollars and why was he wrong?

I did some research and i found some answers let's break them down:

### Why did Mexico default on its debt?

> After all, in 1929 a 15 percent rally
> was followed by the greatest crash of all time. In October, I laid out my
> prognosis in a memo. As I saw it, there was a 75 percent chance the Fed’s
> efforts would fall short and the economy would move into failure; a 20
> percent chance it would initially succeed at stimulating the economy but still
> ultimately fail; and a 5 percent chance it would provide enough stimulus to
> save the economy but trigger hyperinflation.

2. How could the US banks lend about 250 percent of their capital to Mexico and other countries?
   it seems it was vaild during that time after that US changed the plicy.
