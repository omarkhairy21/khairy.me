# Introduction

The past few weeks i was swtich some backend project to use typescript and the frontend during that time was
alredy typescript based and it contains types and interfaces the most of them represent the backend models.
So we switched to typescript on the backend and we started to share the types and interfaces between the backend and the frontend.

## The two problems

when setup or share files between folders sepecially with typescript you will face two problems:

1. Add the right package.json setup to each folder(package) to be able to build and run each folder separately.
2. Setup the right tsconfig.json to automatically make ts to watch the changes and build the files.

## Fix the first problem (Adding the right package.json setup to each folder) with workspaces

The first problem can be solved by using the workspaces feature in the package.json file.
The workspaces feature allows you to share dependencies between the packages and it will be installed in the root node_modules folder.

## yarn workspaces vs pnpm workspaces

On the project we already use yarn as a package manager so i went with yarn workspaces.
The main difference between yarn and pnpm is that pnpm uses a single node_modules folder and hard links to the packages that are shared between the packages.
So in that way pnpm is faster than yarn and npm because it doesn't need to install the same package multiple times.
Form storage wise sepecially on large projects pnpm is the best choice.

From my experience i found that pnpm is faster than yarn workspaces.

here is the project structure:

```bash

project
├── app
│   ├── src
│   ├── package.json
│   ├── tsconfig.json
├── server
│   ├── src
│   ├── package.json
│   ├── tsconfig.json
├── packages
│   ├── shared-types
    │   ├── src
    │   ├── package.json
    │   ├── tsconfig.json
├── package.json
```

**app/package.json**

```json
{
  "name": "app",
  "private": true,
  "version": "0.0.0",
  "type": "module",
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "vite",
    "build": "tsc && vite build"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "react": "^18.2.0",
    "react-dom": "^18.2.0"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    // some dev dependencies
  }
}
```

**server/package.json**

```json
{
  "name": "server",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "main": "index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "start": "nodemon --exec ts-node src/index.ts",
    "build": "tsc"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "express": "^4.18.2"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "@types/express": "^4.17.21",
    "@types/node": "^20.11.17",
    "nodemon": "^3.0.3",
    "ts-node": "^10.9.2",
    "typescript": "^5.2.2"
  }
}
```

**packages/shared-types/package.json**

```json
{
  "name": "shared-types",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "main": "dist/index.js",
  "types": "dist/index.d.ts",
  "files": ["dist"],
  "scripts": {
    "build": "tsc"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "typescript": "^5.2.2"
  }
}
```

on shared-types/package.json i added the types field to point to the dist/index.d.ts file
so when i import the shared-types package in the app or server it will automatically import the types and interfaces.

## Adding pnpm workspaces(add pnpm-workspace.yaml file to the root folder)

```yaml
packages:
  - app
  - server
  - packages/*
```

run `pnpm install` to install the packages and the dependencies.

### Add shared-types to the app and server as a dependency

```bash
cd server && pnpm add shared-types
```

```bash
cd app && pnpm add shared-types
```

## Fix the second problem (Setup the right tsconfig.json)

To automatically make ts to watch the changes and build the files.

### the composite option

on `package/shared-types/tsconfig.json` i added the composite option to true.

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "module": "commonjs",
    "target": "es6",
    "rootDir": "./src",
    "outDir": "./dist",
    "esModuleInterop": true,
    "declaration": true,
    "composite": true
  }
}
```

The composite option is used to enable the package to be used with package references(we will use it later to reference the shared-types package in the app and server tsconfig.json file).

Add the references field to the app and server tsconfig.json file
on the app and server tsconfig.json file i added the references field to point to the shared-types package.

**app/tsconfig.json**

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "target": "ES2020",
    "useDefineForClassFields": true,
    "lib": ["ES2020", "DOM", "DOM.Iterable"],
    "module": "ESNext",
    "skipLibCheck": true
    // some other options
  },
  "include": ["src"],
  "references": [
    {
      "path": "../packages/shared-types"
    }
  ]
}
```

**server/tsconfig.json**

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "module": "commonjs",
    "target": "es6",
    "rootDir": "./src",
    "outDir": "./dist",
    "esModuleInterop": true,
    "composite": true
  },
  "references": [
    {
      "path": "../packages/shared-types"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Trying imort the shared-types package in the app and server

```typescript
import express from 'express'

import { Product } from 'shared-types'

const app = express()
const port = 3000

const products: Product[] = [
  { id: '1', name: 'Product 1', price: 100 },
  { id: '2', name: 'Product 2', price: 200 },
  { id: '3', name: 'Product 3', price: 300 },
]
```

## The final folder structure

```bash
project
├── app
│   ├── src
│   ├── package.json
│   ├── tsconfig.json
|   ├── pnpm-lock.yaml
├── server
│   ├── src
│   ├── package.json
│   ├── tsconfig.json
|   ├── pnpm-lock.yaml
├── packages
│   ├── shared-types
    │   ├── src
    │   ├── package.json
    │   ├── tsconfig.json
    |   ├── pnpm-lock.yaml
├── package.json
├── pnpm-lock.yaml
├── pnpm-workspace.yaml
```

## Why do they use turborepo on large open source projects?

Turborepo is a tool that makes it easy to manage monorepos with pnpm and typescript.
On large open source porject like cal.com[https://github.com/calcom/cal.com] they use it for fast building or running developing tasks like testing or linting.
Turborepo depend havily on caching so it would reduce signficantly the time to build or run the tasks as well as CI/CD pipelines time and cost.

I am still exploring turborepo i may write a post about it in the future, but for simple projects i think pnpm workspaces is enough.

The Full code is available on my repo[https://github.com/omarkhairy21/mono-bold].
